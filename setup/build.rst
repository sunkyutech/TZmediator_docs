.. hint::

    By referencing an existing and locally saved repo forest you can save lots
    of time. We are talking about doing repo sync in 30 seconds instead of 15-30
    minutes (see the :ref:`tips_and_tricks` section for more details).

.. note::
    If you've built using our manifest you should not need to modprobe any
    OP-TEE/TEE kernel driver since it's built into the kernel in all our setups.
